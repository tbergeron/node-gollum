## Goal
When developing one of my project, I wanted to make a website with my GitHub project's wiki integrated into it.

This tool is made to serve a GitHub's Gollum wikis. The final goal is to support all components of Gollum RedCarpet markdown syntax.

You can define a header and a footer, so the wiki will look as a part of your website.

This **won't** support editing, that's what [Gollum](https://github.com/github/gollum/) is made for. This is simply to provide a way of integrating your GitHub project's wiki into your existing website.

## Left to be done:
- regex for code snippets (```)
